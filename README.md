# LSTM Model

This project analyzes audio emotions using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. This project aims to classify emotions (such as happy, sad, angry, etc.) present in audio files. It involves processing audio signals, extracting features, and training a machine learning model to predict audio emotions from CREMA-D dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/cremad?resource=download).
